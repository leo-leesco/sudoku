# TODO list

## Strategies

- [ ] cross out lines/columns when a number is localized inside a square on a line/column
- [ ] select number when it is the last possible in a position
- [ ] alternatives : when two numbers have exactly the same positions on a line/column/square, cross out all other numbers at those positions
- [ ] rectangle pattern transforms lines into columns and reciprocally
